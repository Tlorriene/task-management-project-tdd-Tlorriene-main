The purpose of this project is to build a simple JavaScript application to manage tasks, following a **test-driven development** approach. 

We want to ensure that the emphasis is on practicing all the test-driven development concepts covered by the course. Therefore, in building this simple application, we will focus on **happy path scenarios** to begin with.

When you have completed the requirements below, please feel free to add tests for **unhappy path scenarios**.

## Session Task
